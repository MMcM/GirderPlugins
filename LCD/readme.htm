<h1>Girder plug-in for LCD/VFD displays</h1>
Version 1.14. &nbsp;MMcM 08/02

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Before you can use this plug-in, you must install and configure 
<a href="http://lcdriver.pointofnoreturn.org/">LCDisplay</a>.  You may
also want to test that it works by itself before proceeding.  Any
hardware that works with that driver ought to work with this plug-in.

<h3>Use</h3>
This plug-in displays bits of text on chosen area of the display.
The area is specified by the starting row and column and the number of
characters.  The text can come from several places:
<ul>
<li>A fixed string, possibly expanding variables.
<li>The contents of a string variable, as set by some other plug-in, or the event payload.
<li>The current date and time, formatted using a <code>strftime</code> control string.
</ul>
<p>
A number of lines of the display can be filled at once.  This does not
give as fine control over placement or width.  It is most suitable when a number
of variables are being expanded in the text.
<p>
Several special actions that are also possible:
<ul>
<li>Clearing the display.
<li>Closing the display so that it can be used by other applications.
<li>The contents of a string variable, interpreted as a filename.  Any
directory and file type portion of the name are stripped before
display.
</ul>
<p>

The most interesting use is with the DVDSpy Hardware plug-in, which
generates events when the state of a software DVD player changes.
These events are accompanied by payload text, which can be displayed
using variable <code>pld<i>n</i></code>.  See the <a
href="../../hardware/dvdspy/readme.htm">readme</a> file for that
plug-in for more details.  A sample Girder file is included that
displays some information in a format suitable for 4x20 displays.<p>

<h3>Marquee mode</h3>
LCDriver supports continuous horizontal scrolling display for some
devices.  (Apparently only CrystalFontz displays.)  This can be
simulated, with a lot more flickering, by redrawing the entire row
periodically.  Text which is too large to display all at once (up to
twice the width of the display) can be displayed in this way by
choosing Marquee.  The text occupies the entire row; neither the
starting column nor the width is given.  Only one such row can be
active at a time.  If the actual text fits in the row, it is displayed
normally.<p>

The registry key
<kbd>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Girder3\SoftPlugins\LCD</kbd> can
contain a <kbd>MarqueePixelWidth</kbd> value, specifying the amount
that the display scrolls each step.  <kbd>1</kbd> gives smooth
scrolling; <kbd>6</kbd> scrolls one character at a time.  A
<kbd>MarqueeSpeed</kbd> value specifies the time between steps, in
units of 1/96 second.  <kbd>16</kbd> scrolls six times per second, or
one character per second with pixel width <kbd>1</kbd>.  <kbd>96</kbd>
scrolls once a second, or one character per second with pixel width
<kbd>6</kbd>.  If a <kbd>MarqueeSimulated</kbd> value is set to
<kbd>True</kbd>, the row is redrawn at the specified frequency by the
plug-in.  <kbd>MarqueePixelWidth</kbd> is taken into account when
computing the actual speed, but the row is always be drawn on a
character boundary.  If missing or set to <kbd>False</kbd>, the
LCDriver API function is used.  In that case, if the display does not
support marquee, as much of the text as fits is displayed normally.<p>
