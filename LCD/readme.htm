<h1>Girder plug-in for LCD/VFD displays</h1>
Version 1.10. &nbsp;MMcM 05/02

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Before you can use this plug-in, you must install and configure 
<a href="http://lcdriver.pointofnoreturn.org/">LCDisplay</a>.  You may
also want to test that it works by itself before proceeding.  Any
hardware that works with that driver ought to work with this plug-in.

<h3>Use</h3>
This plug-in displays bits of text on chosen area of the display.
The area is specified by the starting row and column and the number of
characters.  The text can come from several places:
<ul>
<li>A fixed string, possibly expanding registers
(<kbd>[reg<i>n</i>]</kbd>) or text registers (<kbd>[treg<i>n</i>]</kbd>).
<li>The contents of a string register, as set by some other plug-in.
<li>The current date and time, formatted using a <code>strftime</code> control string.
</ul>
Several special actions that are also possible:
<ul>
<li>Clearing the display.
<li>Closing the display so that it can be used by other applications.
<li>The contents of a payload string.
<li>The contents of a payload string, interpreted as a filename.  Any
directory and file type portion of the name are stripped before
display.
</ul>
<p>

The most interesting use is with the DVDSpy Hardware plug-in, which
generates events when the state of a software DVD player changes.
These events are accompanied by text in string register #1.  See the
<a href="../../hardware/dvdspy/readme.htm">readme</a> file for that
plug-in for more details.  A sample Girder file is included that
displays some information in a format suitable for 4x20 displays.<p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
You use this plug-in at your own risk.

<h3>Contact</h3>
To report problems or make suggestions, post a message to the Girder
forum, rather than sending email directly.
