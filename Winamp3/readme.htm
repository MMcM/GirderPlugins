<h1>Girder plug-in for Winamp 3.x</h1>
Version 1.0. &nbsp;MMcM 08/02

<h3>Use</h3>

This plug-in interfaces to Winamp version 3.<p>

It provides bidirectional communication between Winamp and Girder,
sending player state changes as Girder events and allowing Girder
commands to in turn affect / query the state.<p>

<h3>Files</h3>
These are the files contained in this archive and what purpose they serve.
<ul>

<li><kbd>readme.htm</kbd><br/>
This file.<p>
</li>

<li><kbd>Winamp3.dll</kbd><br/>
The Girder plug-in proper.<p>

This file must be placed in the <kbd>Plugins</kbd> folder
beneath where Girder is installed.<p>
</li>

<li><kbd>girder.wac</kbd><br/>
The Winamp component for Girder.<p>

This file must be placed in the <kbd>wacs</kbd> folder
beneath where Winamp is installed.<p>
</li>

<li><kbd>preferences.xml</kbd><br/>

<kbd>girder.wac</kbd> and the whole <kbd>xml</kbd> subfolder from the
directory where the archive was unzipped into the <kbd>wacs</kbd>
folder under <kbd>Winamp3</kbd> using the Explorer.<p>
