<h3>Background</h3>

This plug-in is designed to call Java code.  It wraps the Girder 
<a href="http://www.girder.nl/devel32/api32.php">API</a>.<p>

The Java documentation is <a href="javadocs/index.html">here</a>.

<h3>Notes</h3>

</ul>

<li>You may need to adjust Girder's path in ... if Java is not
normally in the path.  You will need both <kbd>jre\bin</kbd> and
<kbd>jre\bin\hotspot</kbd>.
</li>

<li>The JVM currently listens for a remote debugger unconditionally on
port 1999.
</li>

<li>Nothing has been done about wrapping the OSD functions.  This
does not seem necessary, since they are available in separate plugins.
If it were done, there would be a <code>GirderOSD</code> class to wrap
both the settings and the display.  It would have to take care of
drawing on the DC given a string and so on.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
You use this plug-in at your own risk.

<h3>Contact</h3>
To report problems or make suggestions, post a message to the Girder
