<h1>Girder plug-in for PowerMate</h1>
Version 1.0. &nbsp;MMcM 08/02

<h3>Use</h3>

This plug-in interfaces to the Griffin PowerMate USB control knob.<p>

Events are generated when the knob turns or is pressed.  The event
payload is the increment as a decimal number.  Almost always, this is
<code>1</code>, since the program keeps up with the device.  To handle
this properly as a count, such as when simulating keyboard input, an
action is provided that calls a command <code>[pld1]</code> times.<p>

Additional actions are provided to adjust the LED on the knob: its
brightness and whether it pulses.<p>

<h3>Files</h3>
These are the files contained in this archive and what purpose they serve.
<ul>

<li><kbd>readme.htm</kbd><br/>
This file.<p>
</li>

<li><kbd>PowerMate.dll</kbd><br/>
The Girder plug-in proper.<p>

This file must be placed in the <kbd>Plugins</kbd> folder
beneath where Girder is installed.<p>
</li>

<li><kbd>Test.gml</kbd><br/>
Some tests using OSDMenu.  Press and hold the knob to display a menu.
Rotate to select an item.  Depending on the choice, the knob can then
control its LED brightness or the sound card volume.<p>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

</ul>

<li>
The plug-in does not use non-blocking I/O yet.  As a result, disabling
input or exiting Girder may hang until the knob is turned.  This makes
it impractical for production use at the moment.
</li>

<li>
The <kbd>PowrMate.sys</kbd> device driver must be installed, but the
<kbd>PowerMate.exe</kbd> program must not be running.  Normally it
starts with Windows.  You may need to remove it from
<kbd>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</kbd>
using regedit.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
You use this plug-in at your own risk.

<h3>Contact</h3>
To report problems or make suggestions, post a message to the Girder
forum, rather than sending email directly.
